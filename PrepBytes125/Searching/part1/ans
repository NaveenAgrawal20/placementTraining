https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/

Find the pivot element. for eg in array(3 4 5 1 2), pivot is 5.
You can find pivot elements using binary search.
After this, apply binary search on two subarrays, array(0-pivot) and array(pivot+1,n).
Another optimal solution is to, Modify your binary search conditions to apply on the whole array.
We can search an element in one pass of Binary Search. Think About this approach.
After finding the mid element, check if the first half is sorted or not and similarly for the second half, and develop conditions accordingly.
