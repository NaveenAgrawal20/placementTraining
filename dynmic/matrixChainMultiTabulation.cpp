40 20 30 10 30
Input: p[] = {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}   
Output: 26000  
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 40x20, 20x30, 30x10 and 10x30.
Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
(A(BC))D --> 20*30*10 + 40*20*10 + 40*10*30

Input: p[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 30} 
Output: 30000 
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 10x20, 20x30, 30x40 and 40x30. 
Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
((AB)C)D --> 10*20*30 + 10*30*40 + 10*40*30

Input: p[] = {10, 20, 30}  
Output: 6000  
There are only two matrices of dimensions 10x20 and 20x30. So there 
is only one way to multiply the matrices, cost of which is 10*20*30
